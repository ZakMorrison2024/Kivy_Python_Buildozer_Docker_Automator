# Dockerfile and Buildozer Automation App

## Overview
This app automates the creation of `Dockerfile` and `buildozer.spec` files. It allows you to:
1. Upload Python files to scan for dependencies.
2. Configure `buildozer.spec` through a graphical interface.
3. Generate and update `Dockerfile` configurations based on scanned dependencies.

## Work in Progress
Please note that this app is currently a **work in progress** and is **not fully functional** at the moment. The main features are still being developed, and some parts of the app do not yet work as expected.

### Known Issues:
- The app does not fully handle dependency scanning and management.
- Some configuration screens are still under development.
- Features like logging and detailed dependency checks are planned for future updates.

## Features to Come:
- **Logging**: The app will eventually include detailed logging for actions and errors.
- **Dependency Check**: A more robust dependency checker will be added to ensure accurate results.

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (e.g., Kivy, Buildozer).
